### R1 + R2) Identify the problem you are trying to solve by building this app, Why is it a problem that needs solving?

My project is built to create a central location for bands and venues to post upcoming shows and for users to be able to mark themselves as attending the show. I believe this is a solution to the problem where in the local music scene there isn't really a centralized platform that is solely focused on shows. Often you need to follow bands or venues, periodically checking for updates when new shows are happening.
